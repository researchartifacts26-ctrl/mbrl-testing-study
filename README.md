## Artifact Overview

The artifact consists of **seven executable Jupyter notebooks**, each corresponding to one environment–agent pair:

| Notebook | Agent | Environment |
|--------|------|------------|
| `N01_DynaQ_Taxi.ipynb` | Dyna-Q | Taxi |
| `N02_DynaQ_Frozenlake.ipynb` | Dyna-Q | FrozenLake |
| `N03_MuZero_Connect4.ipynb` | MuZero | Connect4 |
| `N04_MuZero_Cartpole.ipynb` | MuZero | CartPole |
| `N05_PETS_Pendulum.ipynb` | PETS | Pendulum |
| `N06_DreamerV3_Crafter.ipynb` | DreamerV3 | Crafter |
| `N07_MuZero_Lunalander.ipynb` | MuZero | LunarLander |

Each notebook:
- loads a fixed, pre-trained agent
- executes 18 RL testing frameworks
- computes standardized metrics (FR, TTF, APFD, APFD-time)
- generates tables and plots

## Running the Artifact

This artifact can be executed either on Google Colab (recommended) or locally.

---
### Google Colab (Recommended)
Each notebook includes a Google Colab–specific setup cell.
Steps:
1. Upload the repository to Google Drive
3. Open a notebook from the `notebooks/` directory
5. Run all cells sequentially (or use "run all")

All required output folders are created automatically during execution.
---
### Local Execution
Each notebook also includes a local path configuration cell, for example:
```python
AGENT_ROOT  = Path("mbrl-testing-frameworks-empirical-study/agents/muzero/cartpole")
RESULTS_DIR = Path("mbrl-testing-frameworks-empirical-study/results/cartpole")

Requirements: Python ≥ 3.9, Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Large Model Files (DreamerV3)

The DreamerV3 checkpoint (`agent.pkl`) is not included in this repository due to file size constraints.
🔗 [DreamerV3 agent checkpoint (Zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/records/18528220)
### Using the Real DreamerV3 Policy
To run the Crafter experiment with the real DreamerV3 agent:
1. Download `agent.pkl` from Zenodo
2. Place it under: agents/dreamerv3/crafter/
3. In `N06_DreamerV3_Crafter.ipynb`, set:
    ```python
    USE_REAL_DREAMER = True
    ```markdown
   
### Default Behavior
By default, the notebook runs with a competent fallback policy that preserves: action distribution characteristics, interaction frequency, oracle semantics
This ensures the notebook remains fully executable even without the large binary file.


---
## Expected Outputs
After executing a notebook, the following artifacts are generated under:

*tables/*

- Single-row metric summaries per testing framework
- 
*figs/*

- Failure Rate bar plots
- Cumulative Failures vs Tests
- Cumulative Failures vs Time
- 
*raw_single/*

- Per-episode failure logs

## Anonymity Statement
This repository is fully anonymized for double-blind review:
- no author names or affiliations are included
- no identifying metadata is present
- external resources (e.g., Zenodo) are referenced without attribution
